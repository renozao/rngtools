Title: Utility Functions for Working with Random Number Generators
Description: Provides a set of functions for working with
    Random Number Generators (RNGs). In particular, a generic
    S4 framework is defined for getting/setting the current RNG, or RNG data
    that are embedded into objects for reproducibility.
    Notably, convenient default methods greatly facilitate the way current
    RNG settings can be changed.
